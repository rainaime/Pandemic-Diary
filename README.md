# Pandemic Diary
Welcome to the portion of the site we've completed for Phase 1 of the CSC309 group project! The frontend of the website is complete, with animations across views in the single page that makes up our app.

==========SCREENSHOT OF APP HERE====================

## Getting Started
To run the server:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/csc309-summer-2020/team01.git
$ cd team01
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
The website will automatically be opened in your default browser and you'll see the landing page. If you scroll down, you'll see some features & instructions. If you just want to enter the app, click `Enter Site`.

### Credentials & Permissions
For Phase 1, we've hardcoded it so that the user is automatically logged in as `user`. There are other accounts that can be experimented with to explore app functionality:
|Username|Password|
|--------|--------|
|admin|admin|
|user|user|
|user2|user2|

We would validate user logins and registrations server-side in Phase 2. 

Currently, users have permissions to:
- Select the date they'd like to explore
- Share content with other users, and receive notifications of content they've received
- Move around on & place shareable-markers on the map
- Modify (edit and delete) shareable-markers they've placed
- Add a Tweet to the Tweets container
- View News articles

Administrators have permissions to, on top of the aforementioned:
- Delete users
- Modify all markers

## Features
Here are some illustrations of user interactions that are available:
